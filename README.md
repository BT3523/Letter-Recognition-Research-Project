Letter Recognition Using Machine Learning
This project explores the use of various machine learning models to accurately classify capital letters based on their pixel features. The dataset used is the UCI Letter Recognition dataset, consisting of 20,000 observations and 17 variables, detailing attributes such as position, size, and pixel density of capital letters.

Objective
The primary objective is to determine whether a machine learning model can accurately classify capital letters and to identify which features are most significant in distinguishing different letters. We also aim to compare the performance of three different machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.

Models and Techniques
1. Random Forest
Selected for its robustness in handling complex interactions and noisy data.
Achieved an accuracy of 96.47%, with key predictors identified as "x.ege", "y.ege", and "y2bar".
Demonstrated strong performance, particularly in distinguishing visually similar letters.
2. Decision Tree
Chosen for its simplicity and interpretability.
Initial accuracy was 48.07%, which was improved to 54.65% after tuning the model.
Highlights the trade-off between model simplicity and predictive power.
3. Neural Network
Designed with 13 hidden layers after extensive testing for optimal accuracy and efficiency.
Achieved a mean test accuracy of 85.65%.
Showcased the power of deep learning but did not surpass the performance of Random Forest.
Conclusion
Among the models tested, the Random Forest proved to be the most effective, offering the highest accuracy in classifying letters. This project underscores the importance of comparing multiple algorithms and fine-tuning them to achieve the best results in machine learning tasks.
